# Music-Genre-Classification-using-Machine-and-Deep-Learning-Algorithm

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate music genre classification system that categorizes audio records automatically. Given the subjective nature of musical genres, classification remains a complex ask. This project focuses on feature extraction, data preprocessing, and applying machine learning and deep learning models for precise predictions. Beyond building the best model, we aim to compare the performance of various models on the same dataset. We will evaluate traditional ML methods, CNNs, and RNNs while also training and testing a transformer-based model. By benchmarking different approaches, we aim to create a robust
classification framework applicable to real-world scenarios.
